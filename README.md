# CS50P Python Course Exercises

## Introduction
Welcome to my collection of exercises from the [CS50P Python course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/). This repository contains the work I've done throughout the course, demonstrating my understanding and application of Python programming concepts.

## Course Overview
CS50P is an introduction to programming in Python, an intensive, Harvard University course designed for people with or without prior programming experience. Throughout this course, I've learned the essentials of programming in Python and applied these skills in various exercises.

## Repository Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a week in the CS50P course, containing the exercises and projects I completed.

## How to Use
To run any of these exercises, you'll need Python installed on your computer. Most exercises can be run by simply navigating to the exercise directory and executing:

```bash
python filename.py
```

Replace `filename.py` with the actual file name of the exercise you want to run.

## Featured Projects
In this section, I highlight some of the key projects and exercises that I found particularly interesting or challenging:

## Featured Projects
In this section, I highlight some of the key projects and exercises from the CS50P Python course that I found particularly interesting or challenging:

- **Adieu**: A special project focusing on user input and string manipulation. This exercise involved creating a script that takes multiple names as input and prints a farewell message, incorporating the use of the `inflect` library for grammatically correct string concatenation.
- **Indoor**: This exercise was about transforming input strings into a quieter form. I learned to use Python's string methods effectively, like `lower()`, to manipulate strings and transform their case.
- **Playback**: An intriguing challenge where I simulated slower speech by replacing spaces in a string with ellipses (`...`). It was an excellent way to practice string manipulation and understanding Python's string methods.
- **Faces**: This involved replacing textual emoticons with their emoji counterparts. It was a fun way to explore string replacement and gain a deeper understanding of Python's string handling capabilities.
- **Einstein**: A problem set based on Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula, `E = mc^2`. It provided a good exercise in working with mathematical operations in Python and reinforced my understanding of type casting and basic Python data types.

These projects not only helped solidify my understanding of Python but also challenged me to think critically and apply problem-solving skills in a programming context.

## Learning Journey
Reflecting on this course, I've gained a deeper understanding of Python programming and its practical applications. Some key takeaways include:

- Understanding of fundamental programming concepts.
- Practical experience with Python libraries and frameworks.
- Problem-solving and debugging skills.
