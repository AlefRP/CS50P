# Dice Rolling Application
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/NIqerSDCuXA>
#### Description:
This is a Python program that simulates rolling multiple six-sided dice and allows users to guess the sum of the numbers rolled. The program calculates the probability of achieving the guessed sum and provides an ASCII art representation of the dice faces for a more engaging user experience. It was inspired by the tutorial "Build a Dice-Rolling Application With Python" from Real Python, but has been significantly modified and enhanced to offer additional features and a completely different implementation.

The main features of the Dice Rolling Application include:

- Rolling multiple dice (between 1 and 6) at once
- Allowing users to guess the sum of the numbers rolled
- Calculating the probability of achieving the guessed sum
- Displaying the ASCII art representation of the dice faces
- Providing an interactive and user-friendly command-line interface

Through the use of Python's built-in libraries, this program offers a fun and educational experience for users who want to learn more about probability and the process of simulating dice rolls using Python.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3

### Installation

1. Navigate to the directory:

`cd dice-rolling-app`


### Usage

Run the program with the following command:

`python dice_rolling.py`

Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/NIqerSDCuXA) to learn more about the program and see it in action.

The program will prompt you for the number of dice to roll and your guess for the sum of the dice values. The program will then simulate rolling the dice, display the ASCII art for each face of the dice, and output the probability of getting the guessed sum. Finally, the program will inform you if your guess was correct or not.
